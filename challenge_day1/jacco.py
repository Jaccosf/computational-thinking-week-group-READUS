    return f"{char_2} was found dead on a cold, rainy night. {char_3} swore he was at the movies when {char_2} was killed, and he had the ticket stubs to prove it. {char_1} said he was home, streaming a show, and his brother vouched for him. But {char_4}’s alibi was a bit shaky — he claimed to be at the gym, though no one remembered seeing him there. Each of them seemed sure of their story, but {char_2} was still dead, and someone had to be lying."

def paragraph2():
    return f"{char_1} started turning up the heat, pressing {char_3} to explain why he was so calm. {char_3} insisted he had no reason to kill {char_2} — they’d barely even known each mother. But {char_1} wasn’t convinced. He started asking about {char_3}’s ticket stubs, wondering if they could be fake. {char_4} watched, pleased that {char_3} was in the hot seat instead of him."

def paragraph3():
    f"{char_1} decided to dig deeper into {char_4}'s story. He asked around at the gum and found out no one had seen {char_4} that night. {char_1} confronted {char_4}, accusing him of faking his alibi. {char_4} panicked, saying he had no reason to kill {char_2} and was only trying to protect himself from suspicion. {char_3}, seeing {char_4} squirm, realized he might be onto something."
