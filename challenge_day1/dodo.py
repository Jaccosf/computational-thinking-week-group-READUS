He admitted he had doubts about {char_4()}’s gym story. {char_1} jumped on this, asking {char_2} if anyone could verify his whereabouts. {char_4()}, realizing his fake alibi might be exposed, got defensive. He said it was just bad luck that no one saw him at the gym — but {char_3} and {char_1} weren’t buying it."
