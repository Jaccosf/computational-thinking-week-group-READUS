    return f"{char_4}, however, was quietly sweating. His gym alibi was fake, and he knew it wouldn’t hold up under scrutiny. Yet, he kept his cool, watching {char_3} and {char_1} tear each other apart. All {char_4} needed was for {char_3} and {char_1} to keep pointing fingers at each other, just long enough for the truth to get buried.

He admitted he had doubts about {char_4}’s gym story. {char_1} jumped on this, asking {char_4} if anyone could verify his whereabouts. {char_4}, realizing his fake alibi might be exposed, got defensive. He said it was just bad luck that no one saw him at the gym — but {char_3} and {char_1} weren’t buying it.
